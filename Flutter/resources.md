1.We're finally ready to start this exciting month-long journey of App Development with Flutter. We will start the first week at a relatively slow pace to ensure everyone is comfortable with the tools and platforms we will use. If you complete all the resources and are left with free time, please let us know about it on Discord, and we will add some optional resources for you.
## So, what is Flutter?
Flutter is a software-development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross-platform applications for platforms like Android, iOS and much more. Flutter is the ideal platform to start App Development because of its beginner-friendly design and easy-to-understand code.
Watch this short video to better understand the use case for Flutter:
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9ceqw5Ny-4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9ceqw5Ny-4)
Hope you'll are now excited to learn App Development in Flutter!
But first, let us learn about Dart, the programming language used for Flutter Development.

2.Dart is a programming language designed by Google specifically for client development, like mobile and web apps.
It is an object-oriented and class-based language (like C# and Java) but also a scripting language (like Python and JavaScript) with a C-like syntax. So, it has the best of all worlds for easy development and fast applications.
Basic Programming knowledge is expected to work quickly on development projects. Since flutter is based on Dart, some basic programming tutorials are provided for the same, so you can get an idea of how things are supposed to work in your application.
Use the DartPad Online IDE throughout this section for dart programming.
[DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/?null_safety=true)
## Dart in-depth
**If you are a beginner in programming and do not know the basics of a programming language like variables, loops, collections etc.,**
**or if you want an in-depth understanding of Dart:**
Follow this playlist from videos 1 to 9:
[Dart Beginners Course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNnAcB93JKV9YAl4QDygDEMfplrt5uUUx)
## Highlights of Dart
**If you are already proficient in a programming language and would like a quick understanding of Dart,** watch this video:
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CTj3x6jgeY&t=157s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CTj3x6jgeY&t=157s)

3.Null safety prevents errors that result from unintentional access of variables set to null. For example, if a method expects an integer but receives null, your app causes a runtime error. This type of error, a null dereference error, can be challenging to debug.
The Dart language comes with sound null safety.
Flutter 3.0 recently incorporated null safety as a mandatory protocol.
Watch these 2 videos to get a thorough understanding of Null Safety in Dart:

6. 
To build any application, we start with widgets – The building block of flutter applications. Widgets describe what their view should look like, given their current configuration and state. Remember, the first impression is the last. You'll always work with widgets if you're planning to start your app development journey with flutter. 
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKueYVtV0eA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKueYVtV0eA)
 **Material App**
A Material app starts with the [MaterialApp](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html) widget, which builds a number of useful widgets at the root of your app.
watch the below video from 7min 45sec time:

## **Scaffold**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcakQFrJVFQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcakQFrJVFQ)
## **Stateless and Hot Reload**
The state of an app can very simply be defined as anything that exists in the memory of the app while the app is running. The widgets whose state can not be altered once they are built are called stateless widgets.

## **Stateless vs Stateful widgets**

State is information that

(1) can be read when the widget is built and

(2) might change during the lifetime of the widget.

A Stateful Widget has its own mutable state that it needs to track. It is modified according to the user's input.

Learn more about Stateful Widgets and how it's different from stateless widgets -

All modern-day apps are made up of multiple screens. Thus, navigating from one screen to another is an essential feature of an app. Here you’ll learn how one can navigate from one screen to another inside a flutter application.

## Navigator

Here are a few methods by which you can navigate through screens.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnp6ptZVs1g&ab_channel=JohannesMilke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnp6ptZVs1g&ab_channel=JohannesMilke)

## Named Routes

Slightly more advanced methods of navigation involve named routes. This technique is helpful especially while building more complex applications.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btuxZkofLbs&ab_channel=JohannesMilke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btuxZkofLbs&ab_channel=JohannesMilke)

## Official documentation

You can find the official documentation for navigation on the links below

[https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/navigation](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/navigation)

## Bottom Navigation Bar

The bottom navigation bar is a very commonly used widget for navigation. It is a material widget present at the bottom of the screen for selecting among a number of screens like the one used by Instagram.

Here’s how you can implement a bottom navigation bar inside your flutter application.
Congrats on making it this far! Now that you have understood the basics of Flutter and developed your first app let us learn how to connect our apps to the internet.

**Please go through the text before going to the videos on any topic in this section (Web APIs).**

## **What is API?**

[Application Programming Interface (API)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrX9scQvY_0) is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user intervention.

## **Where is it used?**

Most applications use API to display user data. We can use the HTTP package, which provides methods to perform operations. REST API uses simple HTTP calls to communicate with JSON data because:

- It uses [await & async](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmTCmDMi4BY&ab_channel=Flutter) features.
- It provides class and HTTP to perform web requests.

## **REST API**

[Representational State Transfer (REST)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQZxI5jAbQQ&ab_channel=DailyTuition) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints for creating web services. REST API is a way of accessing web services simply and flexibly without any processing.

## [Working of REST API:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c09XiwOZKsI&t=151s)

In REST APIs, a request is sent from the client to the server in the form of a web URL as HTTP GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE request. After that, a response comes back from the server in the form of a resource which can be anything like JSON, HTML, XML, or Image.

Four methods in HTTP that are commonly used are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Other methods are less frequently used, like OPTIONS, PATCH and HEAD.

**GET:** The HTTP GET method is used to read (or retrieve) a representation of a resource. In the safe path, GET returns an HTTP response code of 200 (OK).

**POST:** The POST verb is most often utilized to create new resources. In particular, it's used to create subordinate resources. On successful creation, return HTTP status 201.

**PUT:** It is used for updating the capabilities. However, PUT can also be used to create a resource. On successful update, return 200.

**DELETE:** It is used to delete a resource identified by a URI. On successful deletion, return HTTP status 200 (OK) along with a response body.

[How to use these methods.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpLa3NjWqs0)

## **Catch Exception**

When we run a Flutter app, many things can go wrong.

The user may enter an incorrect input, a network request may fail, or we could have made a programmer mistake somewhere, and our app will crash.

[Exception handling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noNs58-CmSE&ab_channel=RivaanRanawat) is a way of dealing with these potential errors in our code so our app can gracefully recover from them.

**Firebase** is Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS). It provides developers with various tools and services to help them develop quality apps, grow their user base, and earn profit. It is built on Google's infrastructure.

Firebase provides tools for tracking analytics, reporting and fixing app crashes, and creating marketing and product experiment.

Firebase is a backend platform for building web and mobile applications. Firebase is fundamentally a collection of tools developers can rely on, creating applications and expanding them based on demand.

Firebase aims to solve three main problems for developers:

- Build an app, fast
- Release and monitor an app with confidence
- Engage users,

Developers relying on this platform to get access to services would have to develop themselves otherwise, enabling them to focus on delivering robust application experiences.

Some of the Google Firebase platform's standout features include databases, authentication, push messages, analytics, file storage, and much more.

Since the services are cloud-hosted, developers can smoothly perform on-demand scaling without hassle. Firebase is currently among the top app development platforms developers across the globe rely upon.

# Add Firebase to your Flutter App

1. [Install the firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#setup_update_cli) (Follow till Log in and test the Firebase CLI)
2. Ensure that you have created a project in your Firebase console. For this, follow: 
    
    [Getting started with Firebase | Firestore | Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/client/get-firebase) (Follow till step 2)
    
3. [Flutterfire Configure](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?continue=https%3A%2F%2Ffirebase.google.com%2Flearn%2Fpathways%2Ffirebase-flutter%23article-https%3A%2F%2Ffirebase.google.com%2Fdocs%2Fflutter%2Fsetup&platform=android) (Follow till step 3 to set up your app to use firebase services)

    Add the above lines of code to your main function in the `main.dart` file
    
    Also, import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart'; in your `main.dart` file to be able to use Firebase commands.
    
    WidgetsFlutterBinding ensures the Flutter engine is ready to render correctly. `Firebase.initializeApp()` has to be used if any Firebase service is used in your app. This ensures Firebase is initialized before the app is rendered and can afterwards perform functions like authorization and data storage within the app.
    
    Note: the main function is changed to an asynchronous function as `Firebase.initializeApp()` returns future, so it has to be awaited before the next piece of code is written, making the code flow asynchronous.

    This demonstrates the manual method of adding all the config files in android and iOS, which the firebase CLI automates. It is absolutely okay to skip this part, as it is done automatically if you have completed the flutterfire config for your app correctly.
    
    Authentication is a Firebase feature offering ready-to-use UI libraries, backends, and convenient SDKs for user application authentication. Authentication is supported through phone numbers, passwords, and providers such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, and others.

## Email and Password Authentication

Before implementing, let's understand the code to authenticate users with their email and password.

1. **Registering email and password**

For using email and password to authenticate users, firstly, we must register the email address and the password on our firebase console.

[https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aCa8DUt2GhjtRNGfT2W7RHakiuoDDV9x2C7v4jeP8jwBSlTDHtxSSdKT16K4B4SSdiGSAMs4nWYiQcf9VHgWC2LBuRdATH57S1Yc0ROcnM_If4kYIPWFCjnjnkag4JclQM7OpeKQ15NMgzeX4x-j3c40a7ohQjmuiJu-4teLpqAY1qYMwRYbRc2JX7nsMw](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aCa8DUt2GhjtRNGfT2W7RHakiuoDDV9x2C7v4jeP8jwBSlTDHtxSSdKT16K4B4SSdiGSAMs4nWYiQcf9VHgWC2LBuRdATH57S1Yc0ROcnM_If4kYIPWFCjnjnkag4JclQM7OpeKQ15NMgzeX4x-j3c40a7ohQjmuiJu-4teLpqAY1qYMwRYbRc2JX7nsMw)

Here, the variable credential calls a function to register the user with email and password set as per the provided variables (`emailAddress` and `password`). In the ideal case, this should register your user to your firebase console in the authentication tab, but it can have errors, so try-catch is used.

`FirebaseAuthException` specifically caters to errors thrown specifically by  `FirebaseAuth`, i.e., errors from the firebase console like the account already exist etc. In contrast, the errors like no internet are managed by normal catch only. 

In the above code snippet, error handling is done by just printing the error message on the terminal but in a more user-interactive way which could show a dialog box to the user about what the error could be showing e.code on the dialog box. You can use [AlertDialog (Flutter Widget of the Week)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75CsnyRXf5I&ab_channel=Flutter) for the same.

1. **Signing in with a registered email and password**

[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I0Pkk4yHtCq30IIWG3A9Z6ywUdklOj0MktcOaEwWt8n_hBibQS5BOP6SP1uxT2Gr6iZR7b_GXJLczlRHZ-KjP88n-eFS5cFDrSjNIosRg79e7Xx0MHFGfzVGNPKBn4HvFLsW5TH14umWZ4Z2cj019a5SojNb-jSbZ8h5hTl8nhRVsxTHTh5FRuQ-vGvB7g](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I0Pkk4yHtCq30IIWG3A9Z6ywUdklOj0MktcOaEwWt8n_hBibQS5BOP6SP1uxT2Gr6iZR7b_GXJLczlRHZ-KjP88n-eFS5cFDrSjNIosRg79e7Xx0MHFGfzVGNPKBn4HvFLsW5TH14umWZ4Z2cj019a5SojNb-jSbZ8h5hTl8nhRVsxTHTh5FRuQ-vGvB7g)

After registering, the user can get authenticated with their email and password, a similar method to registering the user. After the `signInWithEmailAndPassword` method, you can push your designed home screen. Make sure to put the code to push the home screen in the try block, as the screen should only be pushed when no error is encountered.

1. **Logging Out**

[https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qLcQa5vrJiw0eaYDF2ezLyl5Exb5QVb-CxcJXztCZpYd8uWFI0zzC4jKaWHi5jQo-MqwAx90IZZv6PXWwN6hxAmjFMPBoDPRvILb8ELDftEVSqfFXFI0ajklchkAg4_HNcyRJo09on-cd0mNXkrqYGwGjo51M2R35NJvJd44BXxNvVvv_sF8C6HnmKUuhQ](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qLcQa5vrJiw0eaYDF2ezLyl5Exb5QVb-CxcJXztCZpYd8uWFI0zzC4jKaWHi5jQo-MqwAx90IZZv6PXWwN6hxAmjFMPBoDPRvILb8ELDftEVSqfFXFI0ajklchkAg4_HNcyRJo09on-cd0mNXkrqYGwGjo51M2R35NJvJd44BXxNvVvv_sF8C6HnmKUuhQ)

The above code will log out the user from `FirsebaseAuth`

You can implement the above functions in your app by following the below steps:

1. Make a SignIn/SignUp UI to get the email address and password from the user and store them in a variable named so. The widgets that you can use are `TextField`, `ElevatedButton`, etc.
2. Call the function to sign up the user or log in from the `ElevatedButton`, and once the user is logged in without an error, you can push the app's home screen.

Use these steps to implement the functions:

[Authenticate with Firebase using Password-Based Accounts on Flutter | Firebase Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/flutter/password-auth)

You can execute the above-mentioned async function `onPressed` in `ElevatedButton`. Make sure to add the keyword async to the `onPressed` function.

# Google Authentication

You guys must be familiar with such UI of google sign-in, but how to bring this method into your app?

Follow the following steps in order to implement google auth into your app →

1. Set up a Firebase project on the Firebase console and configure fluttterfire in your app directory.
2. Enable Google as a sign-in method in the Firebase console:
    1. In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), open the Auth section.
    2. On the Sign-in method tab, enable the Google sign-in method and click Save
3. Install the `google_sign_in` package from flutter pub.dev by typing in the command `flutter pub add google_sign_in` in your project terminal
4. Now understand the following code workflow and try to implement it on your app.

[https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/c8xrHwyPnRbJlQJeBMkwiByvCPeA2J-zGkcGfKeOl80vtSS6B0ePeaqTdDUvwlYW-5VRT_joxWNtdgYIy4sw4sFm8lnnGwoZQRo3vHsGPAcZrN3ye6hdus4A12I4rBzkgjQsd940x8MUFGySNfeSAkWe7ezrer37hL6dDV6dBdTKfSJzur-GJPVdJqKAkQ](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/c8xrHwyPnRbJlQJeBMkwiByvCPeA2J-zGkcGfKeOl80vtSS6B0ePeaqTdDUvwlYW-5VRT_joxWNtdgYIy4sw4sFm8lnnGwoZQRo3vHsGPAcZrN3ye6hdus4A12I4rBzkgjQsd940x8MUFGySNfeSAkWe7ezrer37hL6dDV6dBdTKfSJzur-GJPVdJqKAkQ)

Above is the implementation of google sign-in but without any error handling. You just need to use an elevated button to call this function. This is made simple by the google_sign_in package. Here `googleSignIn` is the function's name, which could be your choice, whereas `GoogleSignIn` is the name of the function provided by the package.

Firstly, a google account object is initiated, which fetches the account of the user stored on the phone and opens the dialog box when its method `.authentication` is called. If google servers receive the correct google account credentials, they return an `accessToken` and `idToken`, using which you can ask for the user's data stored on Google, like his `name` and `imageUrl` of his Google account profile picture, as done above in try block.

Finally, Firebase needs to be informed that a successful google authentication has been done, and it has to be instructed to store the google user on its console, so `signInWithCredential` is called, and the Google sign-in credentials are retrieved using the `.credential` method of `googleAuthProvider`.

## Log-out

Google log out could be implemented the following way, this logs out the google account and you out of firebase.

[https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6PD5lRaOJ40xTXzhS67sKTZ7h-WKEkNQZ9fkwl4bqawJf9EzTpDh64TGTi37_9Q8HwMdSW306HOs49BnDiqzM28qF3zkXcbXlaYL0HisqI8VRzPVbi0ePyUcIDFCiB_ia5tLDSSRIAn3INqmv2I_ZdF9XZGQaypoVVPD-D_vm4dTTt2MuHLHIDM2_vRCXA](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6PD5lRaOJ40xTXzhS67sKTZ7h-WKEkNQZ9fkwl4bqawJf9EzTpDh64TGTi37_9Q8HwMdSW306HOs49BnDiqzM28qF3zkXcbXlaYL0HisqI8VRzPVbi0ePyUcIDFCiB_ia5tLDSSRIAn3INqmv2I_ZdF9XZGQaypoVVPD-D_vm4dTTt2MuHLHIDM2_vRCXA)

## Maintaining Login State

Have you ever wondered how various apps show Homescreen every time you open the app once logged in and show a login screen after logging out?

[https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/L5pACycdL1XlobYqJtcJjYfEJtNz-Eq8oYr3YRWS6r9_J2DlTyTi_NXbA1Pil80V8titYBaOkGfCV8vNW48MIplLcPfEsS1-UJ0-TiljgvnW7nyynGg1SkZ5pRSceDAk6PZ4O0a3yruk7sr44q-CFo84wLYhCPHKARv-pRbY70BEwBEDH8OVm3jJ_wnEFw](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/L5pACycdL1XlobYqJtcJjYfEJtNz-Eq8oYr3YRWS6r9_J2DlTyTi_NXbA1Pil80V8titYBaOkGfCV8vNW48MIplLcPfEsS1-UJ0-TiljgvnW7nyynGg1SkZ5pRSceDAk6PZ4O0a3yruk7sr44q-CFo84wLYhCPHKARv-pRbY70BEwBEDH8OVm3jJ_wnEFw)

FirebaseAuth provides us with a miraculous method that keeps sending a stream of information which our `StreamBuilder` widget catches. Whenever the user is logged out, the `snapshot` returned by the stream at that particular instant afterwards becomes null, so `hasData` returns false. Hence, `AuthScreen` is rendered. Otherwise, if the user is logged in, then `snapshot.hasData` is true; therefore, `HomeScreen` is rendered.

The best part is that `authStateChanges` only changes at logout or login, so closing the app does not affect it; hence, the app maintains its login state.

**Note**:  If you don't know already about the `StreamBuilder` widget, you can check these videos

## Understanding error messages

You can get different kinds of errors when building a Flutter app. We'll go through some of them here.

One of the most common and relatively easy-to-fix errors is the **Syntax Error**, which generally gets recognized by the IDE and provides suggestions to solve the error. For example, forgetting a semicolon, not providing sufficient arguments to a function, passing a function with the wrong return type, etc. 

Other types of errors are those which aren't recognized by the IDE but pop up when the app runs, i.e., **Runtime Errors**. For example, exceeding the index range of a list or passing a null value to a non-nullable variable etc. 

These errors can be seen in the run tab in the bottom left corner of Android studio. 

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4cbf8ce1-b8d4-41db-bc00-0b24281520ea/Untitled.png)

The important thing to know is that, for Flutter errors, the most helpful messages will be at the top of the error message. For example, in the above image, The error thrown is a **RangeError**, which means we tried to access something that is not in the list's range.

With time (and google), you get more and more experience with the errors and then it's pretty clear what the error means (if not, use google).

## Using the Debugger

Debugging a logical error is difficult, as it doesn't show up on the IDE nor throw any error messages. An example of a logical error would be adding 2 instead of 1 in the default app in Flutter, it doesn't throw any error, but our app isn't functioning as expected. 

The quick and dirty way to narrow down the issue would be to use `print` to track the counter variable changes. But for a complex problem, using print everywhere gets cumbersome.

The other more powerful way to debug is the inbuilt debugger. For that, quit the running app by pressing the stop button and start the app in debugging mode using the bug icon.

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/1ef1af11-e238-4863-8cd7-758a9275ec99/Untitled.png)

Few of the things you can do while in debug mode is adding breakpoints. You can add breakpoints by clicking on the side of the line numbers.

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e60e9276-4af8-40c6-8079-365fc4c5f424/Untitled.png)

A breakpoint will halt the code execution whenever it reaches this code line. You can then even look into the values of variables and properties and find out if everything has the value you expected.

## Databases

A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a [database management system (DBMS)](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/#WhatIsDBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the associated applications, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just a database.

## **Types Of Databases**

1. **SQL** (Structured Query Language)
    
    Examples include MySQL, Oracle Database, SQLite etc.
    
2. **NoSQL** (Not Only SQL)
    
    Examples include MongoDB, Firebase Realtime Database, CouchDB etc.

**Note:** These are only additional resources for reference only. You don't need to learn all of this. We will use our sweet old Firebase database (a NoSQL database) for our App Development journey. 

Though you can use any database solution for your Flutter app, Firebase, backed by Google, provides the most simple and easy integration with your flutter projects.

We will be using cloud Firestore in our course as it is much more organized and scalable, and it is real-time as well (Just some weird ways to name things by Google).

## Collections and Documents

Firestore, just like any other NoSQL database, stores data in collections and documents which could be nested within each other to deal with more complex data. To understand documents and collections go through the following resources→

## **What is Firestore?**

Google Firestore or Cloud Firestore is a part of the Google Firebase app development platform. It is a **cloud-hosted NoSQL database option** for storing and synchronizing data. Users can directly access Firestore from their web and mobile applications with native SDKs.

Users can use it with programming languages such as Java, Unity, Node.js, Go, and C++ SDKs, and there is also support for RPC and REST APIs. The Firestore database facilitates better performance, automatic scaling, peak reliability, and considerable ease of use.

Firestore enables the syncing of data across various client applications through real-time listeners. It uses Access Management and Cloud Identity features from Google for authentication purposes. Firestore enables the storage of ****data as documents, which are stored within collections.

Firestore documents support various data types like numbers, nested objects, and strings. It can be integrated with Google Firebase and the Google Cloud Platform. Developers prefer Firestore due to the reliability and security it offers.

Cloud Firestore supports indexed queries, facilitating the filtering and sorting functions with the single queries option. ACID transaction advantages are also available across collections and documents. Cloud Firestore being serverless, is convenient for developers and reduces the need to set up servers and manage access to data.

## **Firestore Capabilities**

**Real-Time Updates –** Cloud Firestore utilizes synchronization for updating data across connected devices. This capability also enables users to implement one-time fetch queries efficiently.

**Offline Synchronization –** Cloud Firestore performs caching of data being used by an app to let it read, write, query, and listen to data even with an offline device.

**Data Structure –** Cloud Firestore's data model supports hierarchical data structures. Users can store their data as documents that are stored in collections. Documents contain complex nested objects and subcollections.

**Expressive Querying –** Cloud Firestore enables the use of queries for fetching specific individual documents or retrieving documents matching query parameters from a collection. Queries include multiple chained filters and support sorting and filtering.

**Scalability –** Cloud Firestore offers the scalability you expect from the Google Cloud Platform. Some of its capabilities include multi-regional replication, atomic batch operations, assurance of consistency, and support for real transactions.

Before starting to work with the database in your flutter app, make sure firebase is correctly added to your flutter app. Follow [Add Firebase to your Flutter App](https://www.notion.so/Firebase-Overview-fe87e1cb75ad4cfc89aefdabe0c80fea)

## Basic Read/Write Operations with Firestore

[Get started with Cloud Firestore | Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart)

Make sure to initiate your database in test mode to avoid unexpected errors. You can try to add and read data from the above but avoid securing your data as it is not important for the time being since it is for production-ready code.

## Streams and Snapshot

Ever Wondered how chat apps work? 

Till now, we have learned that we can do CRUD operations in a database. So, in our chat app, we can get a list of all previous chats when we open the app, maybe by calling `setState()`.

But what if someone sends a message while we are using the app? 

When they send a message, they press the send button. So, we can call a write method when they press the button and now their message is on our database. 

But how will we see their message on our device? 

Maybe by creating a button to fetch an updated list of messages again. But that sounds terrible, doesn't it? We won't be using WhatsApp as much as we do now if we have to press a button every time to get others’ messages.

This is where the extraordinary concepts of streams and snapshots step in. Cloud Firestore provides streams of data, which are continuously updated and sent to you, just like a live YouTube video stream where you get some snapshots of the YouTubers’ videos in real-time.

This is `streamBuilder`, which builds whatever is inside the `builder` whenever it receives a new `stream` or, rather more accurately, a new data chunk in the present `stream`

Make sure you understand `streambuilder` correctly, as that’s what you would be using in your week 4 assignment. If any doubts, ask your mentor, the above are just a few, there are dozens of resources to learn from.

## Additional resources

You have learnt basic HTTP requests, GET, POST etc. Can we store data on our Firestore database by just sending it as headers in an HTTP request to some REST API endpoint maybe?

The answer is yes. We've been doing it the entire time. Cloud Firestore SDK provides us with functions/methods that do it. Underlying that package, every request to the database is a simple HTTP request.

[Firebase Database REST API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/database)

You can try this on your own if you wish, but that’s just optional as anyway the package simplifies it all.

In many cases, during the development of an app, we are required to implement a particular feature. Many times, what we want is already available as a package contributed by other developers to the Flutter and dart ecosystem. 

### What are packages?

Packages are open-source code libraries which we can incorporate into our apps to make the process easier and less time-consuming.

You can browse and search through the list of flutter and dart packages on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/)

Here is a **video demonstration** of using the Random ID generator package.

Refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/packages-and-plugins/using-packages) to learn more on how to use packages in your project.

### **Using custom fonts in your project**

To use custom fonts in your project, you need to put the font file in a directory named `fonts` in the root of your project and then specify it in `pubspec.yaml`. After which, you are ready to use the fonts in your project.

Here is a video demonstration of how to use custom fonts

You can also refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts) to learn about it.

***PS**- While working with the `pubspec.yaml` file, take care of the indentation to avoid errors*

### Useful packages

Here is a list of some Flutter Packages which we found very useful

- [Shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences)
- [Google Fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts)
- [Animated-bottom-navigation-bar](https://pub.dev/packages/animated_bottom_navigation_bar)
- [Bluetooth connect with flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_blue)
- [biometric/password protection on your app](https://pub.dev/packages/local_auth)
- [url_launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher)

Congratulations on finishing the Week 4 resources!

As you continue your journey to mastering Flutter, there are many great resources available to help you develop and hone your skills.

## Flutter.dev/learn

We think the best resources for learning intermediate to advanced Flutter are the Flutter team's own resources to learn Flutter Development.

[Learn](https://flutter.dev/learn)

The website has 3 different journeys for learning Flutter at different stages: Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.

In this course, we have completely covered the Beginner part and a major portion of the Intermediate part. You can refer to the resources available here for whatever advanced topics you wish to learn.

## Advanced Topics

We have also compiled a list of advanced topics in Flutter you can choose to learn during your Flutter journey.

- Animations in Flutter: Prepackaged and Custom
- Responsive and Adaptive App Design
- Advanced state management (provider/mobX/riverpods)
- MVVC Model (clean code)
- Custom Widgets: Composition and Inheritance
- Flutter Themes
- Advanced Firebase: Notifications, Storage, Analytics, etc.
- Running Native iOS/Android code
- Publishing to App Stores

 Best of luck on your journey, and have fun with Flutter!
