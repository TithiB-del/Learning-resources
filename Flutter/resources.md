1.We're finally ready to start this exciting month-long journey of App Development with Flutter. We will start the first week at a relatively slow pace to ensure everyone is comfortable with the tools and platforms we will use. If you complete all the resources and are left with free time, please let us know about it on Discord, and we will add some optional resources for you.
## So, what is Flutter?
Flutter is a software-development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross-platform applications for platforms like Android, iOS and much more. Flutter is the ideal platform to start App Development because of its beginner-friendly design and easy-to-understand code.
Watch this short video to better understand the use case for Flutter:

Hope you'll are now excited to learn App Development in Flutter!
But first, let us learn about Dart, the programming language used for Flutter Development.

2.Dart is a programming language designed by Google specifically for client development, like mobile and web apps.
It is an object-oriented and class-based language (like C# and Java) but also a scripting language (like Python and JavaScript) with a C-like syntax. So, it has the best of all worlds for easy development and fast applications.
Basic Programming knowledge is expected to work quickly on development projects. Since flutter is based on Dart, some basic programming tutorials are provided for the same, so you can get an idea of how things are supposed to work in your application.
Use the DartPad Online IDE throughout this section for dart programming.

## Dart in-depth
**If you are a beginner in programming and do not know the basics of a programming language like variables, loops, collections etc.,**
**or if you want an in-depth understanding of Dart:**

## Highlights of Dart
**If you are already proficient in a programming language and would like a quick understanding of Dart,** watch this video:

3.Null safety prevents errors that result from unintentional access of variables set to null. For example, if a method expects an integer but receives null, your app causes a runtime error. This type of error, a null dereference error, can be challenging to debug.
The Dart language comes with sound null safety.
Flutter 3.0 recently incorporated null safety as a mandatory protocol.
